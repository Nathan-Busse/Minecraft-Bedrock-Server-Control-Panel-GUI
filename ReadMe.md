It will automatically close the script.

# Step 8

# How to use the server updater feature

# Server features continued

The ```Server Console``` Displays the inputs and outputs and other useful information of the server. 

The ```File``` button gives additional functions such as ```View folder directory```,  ```exit``` and ```force exit``` the script.


The ```Start Server``` button Starts the server.

The ```Backup World``` button Creates a copy of your world which can be executed even while your world is still running meaning you don't have to shut the server down.
How it works is that it pauses the world save temporarily which means that no world correction. The players are still able to play but while it is backing the world up it does not save any changes made.
Once backup is complete world save will be resumed and changes made during the back up and after will be saved.

The ```Players``` Lists the players connected to the server.

The ```Interact``` Send in-game commands through the control panel.

The ```Send Command``` Used to send console commands or in-game commands.

The ```SEND``` button Sends the command to the console.

Type ```stop``` in the ```Send Command``` tab and click ```SEND``` to shutdown the server or close the programme completely.

The server has shutdown successfuly when this message is displayed:

```
Quit correctly
